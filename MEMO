Temporary memo file
===================

This is personal memo for tkng. If you want to discuss about the topic
in this memo, you should post the topic to the ML, instead of rewriting this
file directly.

These issues should be resolved until 0.5.0. I'll remove this meme
until 0.5.0 release.

* require/load

In gauche, require works at compile time, not at executiontime. SigScheme
should be so. Instead of require, load actually works at execution time.

Gauche uses dynamic-load to load shared library. 

* vector

Vector will be very important data structure. Sorted vector data will
make uim faster. In addition, it would reduce memory consumption.

In Gauche, find, map, for-each, and remove are applyicable to vector.
This feature need generic function,  I think generic function is not 
need for SigScheme. So I'll propose 'vector-' prefix to impelement
map, for-each, remove for vector. i.e. vector-map is map for vector.


* define-record-type

Defined as SRFI-9, define-record-tipe should be implemented to replace
current define-record.
