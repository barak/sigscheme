Overview of changes from 0.6.1 to 0.7.0
==

* New features

  - "internal definitions" and "strict toplevel definitions validation"
    features have been configurable

  - Add optional duplicate variable check to 'let', 'let*', 'letrec' and 'do'
    (it is not required by R5RS)

* Specification changes

  - Definition of dotted list length is changed to SRFI-1's from
    SigScheme-speciific one. SCM_LISTLEN_DOTTED(), SCM_DOTTED_LISTP() and other
    dotted list-related macros and functions have been changed so

* Fixes

  - Fix broken GC on systems that have 8-byte aligned malloc(3) such as Cygwin

  - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of definition form on where neither toplevel
    nor internal definition is allowed

  - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of 'begin' that contains definitions and
    expressions intermixed

  - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of <body> that contains definitions and
    expressions intermixed on 'let', 'let*', 'letrec' and function form
    'define'

  - [R5RS] Fix invalid no-expressions <body> acceptance of 'let', 'let*',
    'letrec' and function form 'define'

  - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of binding syntactic keyword as value on
    'define', 'let', 'let*', 'letrec' and 'do'

  - [R5RS] Fix broken per-iteration env isolation of 'do'

  - [R5RS] Fix proper tail recursion incapability of '=>' form of 'cond'

  - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of cond-like '=>' form of 'case' which is not
    defined in R5RS

  - [R5RS] Remove 'delay' and 'force' since they are completely broken

  - Fix broken evaluation of quasiquoted vectors splicing with improper list

  - Fix 64-bit capability of quasiquoted vectors
