About This Release
------------------

This distribution of SigScheme 0.7.4 is latest stable release of the
software. And this release has been adopted by uim 1.4.0, the primary
application of SigScheme.

As declared in 0.6.1 release, the main goal of 0.7.x series is to acquire
stability and standards conformance. Though many parts have been validated
against the standards, reviewed, tested and fixed, following parts are not done
yet. Please keep in mind that using these features involves standards
conformity and/or stability problems.

  - R5RS characters
  - Some string procedures of R5RS
  - Multibyte character encodings
  - R5RS Vectors
  - SRFI-2
  - SRFI-8

And the hygienic macros feature is still likely having a problem. See
doc/spec.txt for details.

  - R5RS hygienic macros

And finally, these features are completely broken and not usable yet.

  - R5RS promises
  - SRFI-1

See the file 'QALog' for further information about the quality assurance state.

Please report us if you find a problem. And if you have a time, run
'make-report.sh' and send us the result regardless of PASSed or FAILed. It
greatly helps the development, especially for non-PC platforms.

Notes for Packagers and System Integrators
------------------------------------------

  - libgcroots has been developed and bundled in this release. Since it is
    installed as a separated library independent of libsscm, please create its
    own package, and make SigScheme package depending on it with
    "--with-libgcroots=installed"

  - The ABI of libsscm varies by configuration. So to make libsscm sharable,
    please specify "--enable-conf=full" and keep other feature options
    untouched for system-installed library

  - The options "--enable-debug" and/or "--enable-backtrace" make SigScheme
    quite heavy. Please keep them unspecified for normal library
