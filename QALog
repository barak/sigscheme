Quality Assurance Log
=====================

The file for developer's own quality management.


Checkpoints
-----------

- Specification conformance check by eyes

  Whether conforms to the expected specification (R5RS, SRFI, or
  SigScheme-local specs such as SAL).

- Specification conformance check by tests

  Ensure the conformance by tests.

- General code review (logic, structure, meaning, validity etc)

- 64-bit data model capability check by eyes

  Whether the codes are capable of LL64(ILP32), LP64, LLP64 and ILP64.

- 64-bit data model capability check by tests

  Ensure the capability by tests.

- Coding style check (doc/style.txt)

  Don't forget checking duplicate evaluation of side-effective expression on
  macro invocations.

- Normal case tests

- Corner case tests


Format and Examples

        * general code review for all core files

  * The unit for status recording is file. Check all functions in a file at a
    time
  * category = (base|core|semicore|r5rs|srfi|opt|ext|other)
  * record comma separated username@revision for each checkpoints
  * don't overwrite per-user checkpoints. i.e. record as "yamaken@r3499,
    yamaken@3670" instead of recording latest "yamaken@3670" only
  * don't fold each line
  * '-' means "unneeded"
  * blank field means "unchecked"

        * procedure.c
          - QA done for eq?, eqv? and equal? @r3868 except for "64-bit by
            tests" and hygienic macros capability. Other parts of procedure.c
            is not validated yet

          Details:
          - Fix a critical bug of 'scm_type' of storage-compact
          - Deprecate test-equation.scm since R5RS specification is not
            reflected well, and test cases are considerably insufficient
          - Add test-{eq,eqv,equal}.scm and complete all required tests I'm
            aware of
          - Specs have been validated against following R5RS sections:
            * eq?, eqv?, equal?
              "6.1 Equivalence predicates"
              "2. Lexical conventions"
              "2.1 Identifiers"

2006-09-02  YamaKen <yamaken AT bp.iij4u.or.jp>

        * eval.c
          - QA done @r3865 and @r3866 except for "64-bit by tests" and
            hygienic macros capability

          Details:
          - Fix a critical bug of 'call' appears on a minor build
            configuration
          - Add tests for 'eval' returns multiple values,
            scheme-report-environment and null-environment to test-eval.scm
          - Add tests for 'apply' invalid forms, single-argument,
            multi-aruguments and returns multiple values to test-apply.scm
          - Specs have been validated against following R5RS sections:
            * apply
              "4.1.3 Procedure calls"
              "6.4 Control features"
            * eval
              "4.1.1 Variable references"
              "4.1.2 Literal expressions"
              "4.1.3 Procedure calls"
              "4.1.4 Procedures"
              "6.4 Control features" (continuation, multiple values)
              "6.5 Eval"
            * interaction-environment
              "6.5 Eval"

          - Specs have been validated against following R5RS sections, but not
            conformed yet although tests are written for the future:
            * scheme-report-environment
              "6.5 Eval"
            * null-environment
              "6.5 Eval"

2006-07-08 YamaKen <yamaken AT bp.iij4u.or.jp>

        * syntax.c
          - QA done @r3704 except for "64-bit by tests" and hygienic macros
            capability and proper tail recursion capability of '=>' form of
            'cond'
          - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of definition form on where neither
            toplevel nor internal definition is allowed
          - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of 'begin' that contains definitions
            and expressions intermixed
          - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of <body> that contains definitions
            and expressions intermixed on 'let', 'let*', 'letrec' and function
            form 'define'
          - [R5RS] Fix invalid no-expressions <body> acceptance of 'let',
            'let*', 'letrec' and function form 'define'
          - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of binding syntactic keyword as value
            on 'define', 'let', 'let*', 'letrec' and 'do'
          - Add optional duplicate variable check to 'let', 'let*', 'letrec'
            and 'do' (it is not required by R5RS)
          - [R5RS] Fix broken per-iteration env isolation of 'do'
          - [R5RS] Fix proper tail recursion incapability of '=>' form of
            'cond'
          - [R5RS] Fix invalid acceptance of cond-like '=>' form of 'case'
            which is not defined in R5RS
          - [R5RS] Remove 'delay' and 'force' since they are completely broken

          Details:
          - Accept '(begin)' as valid internal and toplevel definition as
            defined in "7.1.6 Programs and definitions" of R5RS, and reject as
            expression as defined in "7.1.3 Expressions". This behavior is
            strictly conforms to R5RS and same as Scheme48 1.3. (i.e. '(begin)'
            is valid only at where definitions are allowed)
          - Remove broken internal definition on
            !SCM_STRICT_DEFINE_PLACEMENT. Since it breaks the R5RS internal
            definitions semantics, the macro is replaced with
            SCM_USE_INTERNAL_DEFINITIONS and the feature is made exclusively
            selectable from only 'completely valid' or 'disabled'. The broken
            internal definitions have been withdrawn
          - I found that 'delay' implementation is completely misunderstood and
            broken. So the implementation of 'delay' and 'force' are rewritten
            as "not implemented yet" error generator and separated into
            a placeholder file promise.c
          - Add test-let.scm, test-lambda.scm, test-begin.scm,
            test-define-internal.scm, test-do.scm and complete all required
            tests I'm aware of
          - Add and fix various tests to test-exp.scm, test-syntax.scm and
            test-define.scm
          - Specs have been validated against following R5RS sections:

        * qquote.c
          - QA done @r3649 except for "64-bit by tests"
          - Specs have been validated against R5RS "4.2.6 Quasiquotation" and
            "7.1.4 Quasiquotations"
          - Fix some bugs including a destructive one
          - An unquote-splicing behavior is different to some other
            implementations, but I believe that this implementation is
            proper. See "unquote-splicing nested" of test-quote.scm
