Quality Assurance Log
=====================

The file for developer's own quality management.


Checkpoints
-----------

- Specification conformance check by eyes

  Whether conforms to the expected specification (R5RS, SRFI, or
  SigScheme-local specs such as SAL).

- Specification conformance check by tests

  Ensure the conformance by tests.

- General code review (logic, structure, meaning etc)

- 64-bit model capability check by eyes

  Whether the codes are capable of ILP32(LL64), LP64, LLP64 and ILP64.

- 64-bit model capability check by tests

  Ensure the capability by tests.

- Coding style check (doc/style.txt)

- Normal case tests

- Corner case tests


Format and Examples
-------------------

- Free format log

  Record significant achievements to 'Log' section in ChangeLog format

  * The unit for status recording is file. Check all functions in a file at a
    time
  * category = (base|core|semicore|r5rs|srfi|opt|ext|other)
  * record comma separated username@revision for each checkpoints
  * don't overwrite per-user checkpoints. i.e. record as "yamaken@r3499,
    yamaken@3670" instead of recording latest "yamaken@3670" only
  * don't fold each line
  * '-' means "unneeded"
  * blank field means "unchecked"
