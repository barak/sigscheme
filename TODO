==============================================================================
Requirements and bugs:

* Introduce Exception handling (probably should be based on SRFI-34)
  - Throw an exception instead of exit(3) when an error occurred
  - Rename call/cc with call/ec? ([Anthy-dev 2216])
  - Implement assert-error in unittest.scm
  - [uim] Make uim-sh loop workable even if error occurred

* Support SIOD-compatible verbose message control (suppressing backtrace, GC
  stat, error, etc based on verbose-level)
  - [uim] Make the GaUnit-based testing framework workable

* 
  - Provide a string escaping procedure. If a SRFI or another de facto standard
    API for such purpose is existing, use it
  - [uim] Implement string-escape as same as trunk

* [uim] link libsscm into libuim statically

* Dynamic encoding switching for a conversion between string and char list,
  based on a SRFI or de facto standard API

* grep "FIXME" and fix them

==============================================================================
Extensions:

* SRFI-2 and-let* (significantly beneficial for uim codes, especially composer
  branch)

==============================================================================
Performance improvements:

* Object representation compaction ([Anthy-dev 2353], [Anthy-dev 2360])

* Fix large fixed-size buffer on stack without limit checking in read.c

==============================================================================
Logical simplifications:

* Add tests for proper tail recursion with apply to test-tail-rec.scm

* Automatically append "\n" in SigScm_Error() instead of append by caller

* Split ScmOp_eval()'s function invocation handling off into a separated
  function and share it with ScmOp_apply()

* Eliminate similar codes by SCM_REDUCE*() (grep 'TODO.*SCM_REDUCE' *.c)

* Simplify args extraction codes by SCM_SHIFT*() (grep 'TODO.*SCM_SHIFT' *.c)

==============================================================================
Namings and Cosmetic things:

* Add a add a 'SCM' prefix to functions of sigschemeinternal.h

* Rename 'arg' for argument list to 'args'

* Rename STL names (string, list) to another such as str, lst

* Split configuration macros such as SCM_COMPAT_SIOD off to config.h

* Grand renaming (prefix reorganization, consideration about func_name and
  FuncName styles) ([Anthy-dev 2254], [Anthy-dev 2251])

* Define the coding style for indent(1) and reform *.[ch] by it

* Refill license header with fill-column 79, and insert it into all test files

* Rename datas.c to data.c or storage.c (YamaKen recommends storage.c)
  ([Anthy-dev 2251])

* [uim] Rename uim-scm.c to uim-scm-sigscheme.c

==============================================================================
Assigned to YamaKen:

* GCC4-optimization-proof stack protection
  - [uim] Introduce it into r5rs branch
  - [uim] Port it into trunk
