==============================================================================
Requirements and bugs:

* Fix character and escape sequence related issues. grep Scm_special_char_table
  to find the issues, and make all tests in test-char.scm and test-string.scm
  passed

* Fix Makefile.am

* Introduce Exception handling (probably should be based on SRFI-34)
  - Reimplement with dynamic-wind, and without direct setjmp/longjmp
  - Rename call/cc with call/ec? ([Anthy-dev 2216])

* Add tests for proper tail recursion with 'apply' to test-tail-rec.scm

* 
  - Provide a string escaping procedure. If a SRFI or another de facto standard
    API for such purpose is existing, use it
  - [uim] Implement string-escape as same as trunk

* Add integer->char and char->integer procedures with multibyte support

* Inhibit a mutation on string constants as described in "3.4 Storage model" of
  R5RS

* Fix invalid storage model assumption of ScmOp_append() and qquote_internal()
  with ScmRef

* [uim] link libsscm into libuim statically

* Dynamic encoding switching for a conversion between string and char list,
  based on a SRFI or de facto standard API

* Fix large fixed-size buffer on stack without limit checking in read.c

* grep "FIXME" and fix them

==============================================================================
Extensions:

==============================================================================
Performance improvements:

* Object representation compaction ([Anthy-dev 2353], [Anthy-dev 2360])

* Replace almost ScmObj initialization by SCM_NULL with SCM_FALSE. SCM_NULL is
  not appropriate for such clean initialization. #f is the counterpart of NULL
  of C. And using SCM_FALSE as the default value is the most efficient way in
  macine-code level since SCM_FALSE will be represented by zero after the
  compaction

==============================================================================
Logical simplifications:

* Simplify argument extraction by DECLARE_FUNCTION, ASSERT_*P, POP_ARG and
  NO_MORE_ARG macros in all procedure and syntaxes

* Replace all Scm_ErrorObj() in procedures and syntaxes with ERR_OBJ

* Simplify special character handlings with Scm_special_char_table

* Reorganize SCM_SHIFT*() macros to complement POP_ARG() macro

* Change procedure and syntax registration from dumb function invocation
  sequence to iterating over name-initializer pair, as ScmExp_use() does. This
  change reduces code size and type consistency management cost. The
  name-initializer array should automatically be generated from
  DECLARE_FUNCTION macro (by using some UNIX tools)

==============================================================================
Namings and Cosmetic things:

* Rename "Macro Declarations" of all C files, "Macro Definitions" and move to
  immediately after of "Local Include" section since other declarations and
  definitions sometimes need macros

* Rename STL names (string, list) to another such as str, lst

* Grand renaming (prefix reorganization, consideration about func_name and
  FuncName styles) ([Anthy-dev 2254], [Anthy-dev 2251])

* Define the coding style for indent(1) and reform *.[ch] by it

* Refill license header with fill-column 79, and insert it into all test files

* [uim] Rename uim-scm.c to uim-scm-sigscheme.c

==============================================================================
Assigned to YamaKen:

* Write tests for SRFI-34

* GCC4-optimization-proof stack protection
  - Update the document
