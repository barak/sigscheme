==============================================================================
Requirements and critical bugs:

* Object representation compaction
  - Make all tests passed without error or SEGV

* Clear license, copyright and changes information ([Anthy-dev 2933])
  - scm_length() in list.c
  - "Shiro Kawai" part of read.c
  - slib.scm
  - test/{gauche*,bigloo*}.scm
  - Place all above terms into sigscheme/COPYING

* Autoconfiscate the SigScheme package (don't rely on uim's configure)
  - Make most settings in src/config.h configurable with configure options
  - [uim] configure sigscheme subdir by top-level configure like GCC
  - Check pointer alignment to ensure stack GC workable
    * for example, gcc -Os on x86 breaks the alignment

* Confirm public API
  - Move some interfaces from sigschemeinternal.h to sigscheme.h
  - Evaluate SRFI-50 (although withdrawn)

* Confirm R5RS and SRFI conformance for each function implementation

* Fix all side-effective expression in macros
  - All files except for operations-srfi1.c, storage-compact.h and
    test-compact.c are checked

* Confirm appropriate workaround for the GCC's noinline attribute vanishing
  problem on Linux environments

* Make 64bit-safe
  - Write tests
  - Make the tests passed on actual 64bit environment with storage-fatty
  - Make the tests passed on actual 64bit environment with storage-compact

* grep "FIXME" and fix them

==============================================================================
Low priority bugs:

* fileport_byte_readyp() does not support a FILE based on a pipe, or opened by
  fdopen(3)

==============================================================================
Extensions: (not required for now)

* Complete SLIB support
  - Make the slib.scm installable
  - Fill some variables with configure (slib.scm.in)

* Complete operations-srfi1.c and make it production quality if considerable
  benefit exists against SLIB version of SRFI-1 implementation

* Make Symbian OS and BREW support working (patches are welcome)

* Support SRFI-75 style symbol escaping such as |-sym|
  - Obsolete leading '-' handling in read_number_or_symbol() with it

* Introduce dynamic environment for internal use
  - Fix continuation-unsafe current-{input,output}-port handling with it
  - Replace Scm_current_char_codec handling with it

* Dynamic encoding switching for a conversion between string and char list,
  based on a SRFI or de facto standard API
  - Evaluate ces API of Gauche
  - Consider dynamic environment

* Implement a record type
  - Evaluate SRFI-9 and SRFI-76
  - Make a comparison with uim's define-record

* Make unittest.scm closer to SRFI-64 "A Scheme API for test suites" if
  reasonable

* Implement numbers other than integer
  - Define SAL accessors considering SRFI-50 and other implementations
  - Evaluate SRFI-77 "Preliminary Proposal for R6RS Arithmetic"

* Add GB18030 to encoding.c

* Add Big5 to encoding.c

==============================================================================
Performance improvements:

* (not required for now) Simplify read.c by table-based tokenizer

* (not required for now) Support string of constant-width char
  - Define SigScheme's own internal multi-CCS code
  - Make UCS2 selectable as canonical internal code

==============================================================================
Logical simplifications:

* (not required for now) Reorganize list (argument) extraction API

* (not required for now) Reorganize encoding and char codec API

==============================================================================
Namings and Cosmetic things:

* Consider renaming about typenames (e.g. ScmObj -> scm_obj)

* Rename STL names (string, list) to another such as str, lst

* Define the coding style for indent(1) and reform *.[ch] by it

* [uim] Rename uim-scm.c to uim-scm-sigscheme.c (after the merger)

==============================================================================
Assigned to Kazuki:

* Inhibit a mutation on string constants as described in "3.4 Storage model" of
  R5RS
  - Write both immutable and mutable case tests for all procedures that accepts
    a string

==============================================================================
Assigned to YamaKen:

* GCC4-optimization-proof stack protection
  - Write test
  - Make SCM_GCC4_READY_GC default

* Write test for tail expression of all tail-recursive syntaxes

* Add tests for proper tail recursion with 'apply' and 'guard' to
  test-tail-rec.scm

* Write tests for SRFI-75

* Add integer->char and char->integer procedures with multibyte support
  - Write test
