==============================================================================
Requirements and bugs:

* Investigate behavior of other implementations about constant {vector,list}
  - Implement if needed

* Autoconfiscate the SigScheme package (don't rely on uim's configure)
  - Prepare replace functions (asprintf and so on)
  - Introduce C99-independent stdint.h
    http://autoconf-archive.cryp.to/ax_create_stdint_h.html
  - [uim] configure sigscheme subdir by top-level configure like GCC

* Add tests for proper tail recursion with 'apply' and 'guard' to
  test-tail-rec.scm

* [uim] link libsscm into libuim statically

* grep "FIXME" and fix them

==============================================================================
Extensions: (not required for now)

* Introduce dynamic environment for internal use
  - Fix continuation-unsafe current-{input,output}-port handling with it
  - Replace Scm_current_char_codec handling with it

* Dynamic encoding switching for a conversion between string and char list,
  based on a SRFI or de facto standard API
  - Evaluate ces API of Gauche
  - Consider dynamic environment

* Add GB18030 to encoding.c

* Add Big5 to encoding.c

==============================================================================
Performance improvements:

* Object representation compaction ([Anthy-dev 2353], [Anthy-dev 2360])

* Replace almost ScmObj initialization by SCM_NULL with SCM_FALSE. SCM_NULL is
  not appropriate for such clean initialization. #f is the counterpart of NULL
  of C. And using SCM_FALSE as the default value is the most efficient way in
  macine-code level since SCM_FALSE will be represented by zero after the
  compaction

==============================================================================
Logical simplifications:

* Simplify argument extraction by DECLARE_FUNCTION, ASSERT_*P, POP_ARG and
  NO_MORE_ARG macros in all procedure and syntaxes

==============================================================================
Namings and Cosmetic things:

* Rename "Macro Declarations" of all C files, "Macro Definitions" and move to
  immediately after of "Local Include" section since other declarations and
  definitions sometimes need macros

* Rename STL names (string, list) to another such as str, lst

* Grand renaming (prefix reorganization, consideration about func_name and
  FuncName styles) ([Anthy-dev 2254], [Anthy-dev 2251])

* Define the coding style for indent(1) and reform *.[ch] by it

* Refill license header with fill-column 79, and insert it into all test files

* [uim] Rename uim-scm.c to uim-scm-sigscheme.c

==============================================================================
Assigned to Kazuki:

* Inhibit a mutation on string constants as described in "3.4 Storage model" of
  R5RS
  - Write both immutable and mutable case tests for all procedures that accepts
    a string

==============================================================================

Assigned to YamaKen:

* Separate SCM_ASSERT into required validation optional assertion

* Fix character and escape sequence related issues. grep Scm_special_char_table
  to find the issues, and make all tests in test-char.scm and test-string.scm
  passed
  - Write tests for SRFI-75

* Add integer->char and char->integer procedures with multibyte support
  - Write test

* GCC4-optimization-proof stack protection
  - Update the document
