==============================================================================
Requirements and critical bugs:

* Support SRFI-1
  - Import http://www.math.grin.edu/~stone/srfi/srfi-1-tests.ss

* grep "FIXME" and fix them

==============================================================================
Low priority bugs:

* fileport_byte_readyp() does not support a FILE based on a pipe, or opened by
  fdopen(3)

==============================================================================
Extensions: (not required for now)

* Complete SLIB support
  - Make the slib.scm installable
  - Fill some variables with configure (slib.scm.in)

* Make Symbian OS and BREW support working (patches are welcome)

* Dynamically loadable binary module which allows user-written procedure

* Introduce dynamic environment for internal use
  - Fix continuation-unsafe current-{input,output}-port handling with it
  - Replace Scm_current_char_codec handling with it

* Dynamic encoding switching for a conversion between string and char list,
  based on a SRFI or de facto standard API
  - Evaluate ces API of Gauche
  - Consider dynamic environment

* Implement a record type
  - Evaluate SRFI-9 and SRFI-76
  - Make a comparison with uim's define-record

* Implement numbers other than integer
  - Define SAL accessors considering SRFI-50 and other implementations
  - Evaluate R6RS Arithmetic

* Add ISO-2022-JP support to encoding.[hc] and scmport-mbchar.c. It requires
  encoding API fix on int2str() which lacks post-write state update

* Add GB18030 to encoding.c

* Add Big5 to encoding.c

==============================================================================
Performance improvements:

* (not required for now) Introduce SCM_QNULL for (quote ()) to reduce cons cell
  consumption, and support shortcuts for it in read.c and eval.c

* (not required for now) Simplify read.c by table-based tokenizer

* (not required for now) Support string of constant-width char
  - Define SigScheme's own internal multi-CCS code
  - Make UCS2 selectable as canonical internal code

==============================================================================
Properness improvements: (not required for now)

* Import http://sisc.sourceforge.net/r5rs_pitfall.scm
  - Fix hygienic-macro incapability of module_srfi34.c to catch errors into
    a failed result in the 'should-be' macro

* Support R6RS style symbol escaping such as |-sym|

* Reorganize unit test for C
  - Remove GNU sed dependency of test-c/collect.sh.in
  - Separate SigScheme-dependent part and generic part of test-c, and
    generalize the unit testing utils as usable for uim
  - Name 'the testing utils'

* Make unittest.scm closer to SRFI-64 "A Scheme API for test suites" and
  SRFI-73 "Lightweight testing" if reasonable

==============================================================================
Logical simplifications:

* (not required for now) Encode argument type information into ScmFuncTypeCode
  to remove ENSURE_*() from each procedure implementation

* (not required for now) Reorganize list (argument) extraction API

* (not required for now) Reorganize encoding and char codec API

==============================================================================
Namings and Cosmetic things:

* Consider renaming about typenames (e.g. ScmObj -> scm_obj)

* Rename STL names (string, list) to another such as str, lst

* Define the coding style for indent(1) and reform *.[ch] by it

* [uim] Rename uim-scm.c to uim-scm-sigscheme.c (after the merger)
